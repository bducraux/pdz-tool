# PDZ-Tool

**PDZ-Tool** is a Python library for reading PDZ files and converting them into CSV or JSON formats. PDZ files are commonly used to store data from X-ray fluorescence (XRF) instruments, and this tool allows easy extraction and transformation of the data for analysis.

## Features

- **Read PDZ files in version 24 and 25 formats.**
- **Parse and extract important information from the PDZ file into JSON format.**
- **Convert the parsed data to CSV format for further analysis.**
- **Verbose and debug modes to help troubleshoot issues during parsing.**

## Installation

You can install `pdz-tool` via `pip`.

```bash
pip install pdz-tool
```

## Usage

```python
#### 1.Importing and Initializing PDZTool
from pdz_tool import PDZTool

# Initialize a PDZTool object
pdz_tool = PDZTool('path/to/pdz_file.pdz', verbose=True, debug=True)

#### 2. Parsing a PDZ File
parsed_data = pdz_tool.parse()

#### 3. Accessing Parsed Data as a Dictionary
record_names = pdz_tool.record_names  # Record names found on the pdz file
for record_name in record_names:
    print(f"Record Name: {record_name}")
    print(parsed_data[record_name])
    
#### 4. Converting Parsed Data to JSON
json_data = pdz_tool.to_json()
print(json_data)

#### 5. Saving Parsed Data to JSON File
pdz_tool.to_json('output.json')

#### 6. Saving Parsed Data to CSV
pdz_tool.to_csv('output.csv')
```
